# Weather App

In this project, I have created a weather app using HTML, CSS, ReactJS and the Meteosource Weather API.
## Description

The Weather App is built using React for a dynamic and responsive user interface. It integrates with a weather API to fetch and display real-time weather data. The app features a geolocation service that automatically detects and displays weather conditions for the user's current location. The header includes a logo, a search bar for querying different cities, and a button to quickly access weather data for the current location. The design leverages Flexbox and Grid for a clean, responsive layout, ensuring compatibility across various devices.
